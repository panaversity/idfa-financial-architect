# IDFA Financial Architect

A Claude Code plugin that applies **Intent-Driven Financial Architecture (IDFA)** to every financial modelling interaction — automatically.

IDFA is a methodology for building financial models that are human-readable, AI-operable, and mathematically audit-proof. Developed by the [Panaversity](https://panaversity.org) team.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add panaversity/idfa-financial-architect
/plugin install idfa-financial-architect@panaversity-idfa
```

The plugin ships two skills: **financial-architect** (IDFA methodology — auto-activates on financial model conversations) and **idfa-ops** (programmatic model interaction — Named Range CRUD, compliance auditing, recalculation).

### Cowork (Claude.ai)

1. In the Cowork sidebar, click **Customize** → **Browse plugins** → **Personal**
2. Click **+**, then select **Add marketplace from GitHub**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/panaversity/idfa-financial-architect`
4. Find **IDFA Financial Architect** → click **Install**

### Local Testing

Clone the repo and load it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panaversity/idfa-financial-architect.git
claude --plugin-dir ./idfa-financial-architect
```

### Other Agents (GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Codex, Cursor)

Download `skills/financial-architect/SKILL.md` from this repo and place it in your agent's custom instructions path:

| Agent          | Path                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`            |
| VS Code        | `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md`            |
| Codex (OpenAI) | Project instructions or system prompt        |
| Cursor         | `.cursorrules` or project-level instructions |

The SKILL.md content is identical across all platforms — only the file path changes.

## What It Does

When the plugin is active, the agent automatically applies four deterministic guardrails to every financial model interaction:

1. **Named Range Priority** — every formula uses Named Ranges, zero coordinate references
2. **LaTeX Verification** — complex formulas (WACC, NPV, DCF, IRR) are verified in LaTeX before writing
3. **Audit-Ready Intent Notes** — every AI-generated formula includes an Intent Note documenting its purpose
4. **Delegated Calculation** — the agent writes inputs and reads results via the spreadsheet engine, never calculating internally

## The Three Layers

Every IDFA-compliant model separates:

- **Layer 1 — Assumptions**: inputs only, all prefixed with `Inp_`
- **Layer 2 — Calculations**: Named Ranges only, readable as business rules
- **Layer 3 — Output**: presentation and formatting only

## Prerequisites

| Dependency                       | Required         | Purpose                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Python 3.10+                     | Yes              | Script runtime for `idfa-ops`        |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Yes              | PEP 723 inline dependency resolution |
| LibreOffice                      | Yes (for recalc) | Deterministic formula evaluation     |

This plugin works best alongside Anthropic's `xlsx` skill for deterministic formula recalculation.
